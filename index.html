Whilst many folk make their homes here, it is not known as a residential area. Most of those who live in the district also work there. <br/> <br/> As soon as the gates open in the morning, farmers and smallholders wheel their carts here. Goods such as meat, fresh fruit and vegetables are brought into the city through the South Gate shortly after dawn, and the markets are open from an hour after dawn until dusk. Some of the more successful farmers keep their own stalls and shops within the city, but most sell their wares to a favoured stallholder and make their way back to their farmsteads. <br/> <br/> Altmarkt bustles with commerce as dawn breaks and attracts entertainers and pickpockets making what they can from the crowds. The nearby Altquartier provides the proprietors of Altmarkt with a steady supply of cheap labour, but also presents a threat — the Low Kings.

Graf Dieter thought it a wise move to institute this official channel to care for their interests and didn’t want to offend Halflings by leaving them out. It is not very active now, but is responsible for organising cultural events during festivals. Local Elves sometimes refer to the KEDHI as ‘the dancing hall’, a pun on the Eltharin word for an evening of drinking, music, and dancing. <br/> <br/> There are separate offices for Elves, Dwarfs, and Halflings within the building, staffed by members of each Species, and the Komission deals with all complaints and problems arising from the city’s non-Human population.

The library here takes the form of a rectangular annexe built on to one side of the main temple. It contains the rarest manuscripts from all over the Old World. Supervised access to the library is free to anyone with a letter of introduction from the Worshipful Guild of Legalists, the Grand Guild of Wizards, or the Collegium Theologica.
