Whilst many folk make their homes here, it is not known as a residential area. Most of those who live in the district also work there. <br/> <br/> As soon as the gates open in the morning, farmers and smallholders wheel their carts here. Goods such as meat, fresh fruit and vegetables are brought into the city through the South Gate shortly after dawn, and the markets are open from an hour after dawn until dusk. Some of the more successful farmers keep their own stalls and shops within the city, but most sell their wares to a favoured stallholder and make their way back to their farmsteads. <br/> <br/> Altmarkt bustles with commerce as dawn breaks and attracts entertainers and pickpockets making what they can from the crowds. The nearby Altquartier provides the proprietors of Altmarkt with a steady supply of cheap labour, but also presents a threat — the Low Kings.

Many frontages are decorated with plaster columns and heraldic figurines of exotic beasts such as Dragons and Griffons. </br> </br> Despite their riches, few merchants live here. The aristocrats tend to regard them as newly wealthy peasants, and make any attempts by a merchant to acquire property here exceedingly difficult."},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-2.548828,77.24478],[1.318359,76.65952],[5.449219,76.649377],[10.50293,76.567955],[16.743164,76.205967],[19.160156,76.079668],[20.566406,76.740397],[22.016602,77.370301],[23.686523,78.188586],[24.697266,78.560488],[24.873047,79.063478],[22.939453,79.488638],[14.853516,79.989532],[12.963867,79.974243],[8.964844,80.356995],[2.944336,79.536631],[-1.845703,78.724912],[-2.988281,77.924866],[-2.548828,77.24478]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"popupContent":"<h1>GRAFPLATZ</h1> The Grafplatz is a large precinct area that lies before the gates of the Middenpalaz district. Whilst the square is supposedly open to the public, in truth they are tolerated rather than welcomed. The trickle of respectful visitors are careful to give parading soldiers a wide berth and are left unmolested, but the Watch push loiterers along and force larger crowds to disperse. <br/> <br/> The Grafplatz also serves as an open-air museum. There are a number of statues and memorial plaques dedicated to the glory of historical Grafs and Ar-Ulrics set around the square. However, these days the square is very much a testimony to the power of the Todbringers, and statues of Todbringer Grafs and their coats of arms feature prominently, whilst older statues are being
